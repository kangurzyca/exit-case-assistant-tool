1. to compile .ts to .js with locally installed TS use "npx ts <fileName>.ts"
no need to change paths or install TS globally

2. added scripts for npm - build and start to build TS and generate js files in a separate location.

3. Added type: module in package.json file.

4. in tsconfing file added module: nodenext for some reason. Also outdir to generate js file in seprate folder and declaration files for some reason as well.

5. npm run build and npm start seem to bundle tthings and then ran everything in terminal as I used to do some long time ago.
